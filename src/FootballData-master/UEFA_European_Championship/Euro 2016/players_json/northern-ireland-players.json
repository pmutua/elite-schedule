Started as a goalkeeper at Cardiff City before, disillusioned, he switched to playing as a striker. Replaced the suspended Lafferty in the final home qualifier against Greece and duly scored his first international goal to ease the team’s passage to France. Otherwise used as an impact substitute.",
